# SimpleDotNetCoreWebApp
This is a Simple .Net Core Web App that can be used in GIT, DevOps, Docker or any other demos.

## Prerequisites
You need to have the .Net Core run time installed. The app does not use any kind of Data Base, so it should work as a Hello World kind app.

By Default the app will launch using the 7165 port and provides just 2 vies: Home and Privacy. So the url's should be:
- https://localhost:7165/ for the home view
- https://localhost:7165/Privacy for the privacy view.
